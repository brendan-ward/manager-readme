# Manager README

Written by: Brendan Ward: Software Development Team lead at the [Conservation Biology Institute](https://consbio.org) (CBI).


## Why this README?
I use this document to share my expectations with my team members.  It is intended to be a guide on what I expect from others and what they should expect from me.  My hope is that this helps you better understand how I work and make it easier to work together.  This is public with the intent that it will make it easier for you to hold me accountable.


## Disclaimer
This README applies to me only, and in no way should be considered to apply to any other manager or team at CBI.


## My role
I currently wear many hats: team lead, project manager, project principal, senior engineer.  My core functions generally boil down to:
* provide and clarify context
* set expectations and measure against those
* mentor others
* improve our team processes
* care passionately about the individuals who make our success possible and likely (that's everyone, by the way), over the long term of their careers (not just their time at CBI)
* contribute to CBI strategy
* recruit awesome new team members

Assume that I make mistakes, and that I want to improve (see below), just like you.  You will be doing me a huge favor if you hold me accountable, and tell me if something I am doing negatively affects you.  I am here to serve you, not the other way around.


## My values and expectations
### Communication
Frequent, high-quality communication is essential to our work.  Err on the side of over-communication (dial it up to 11!) and I will help you adapt downward from there.  Optimize for quality over quantity, frequency over perfection, and effectiveness over politeness; this should be a minimal impact to your time.

If something is blocking you, I need to know about it very quickly so that we can strategize together if needed.  I work best when you bring me ideas.  Don't worry about bringing solutions; those take time and I'd rather talk to you sooner.  If you already have the right solution, you probably don't need me.

I should not have to ask you for the status of something you are working on.  I want you to favor pushing information to me rather than me having to pull information from you.

I am held accountable for progress on our projects by our clients and stakeholders.  You should proactively and regularly communicate your progress.  We have a slack bot that gathers this information daily.  We have other technologies (Trello, Jira, etc). Please use these tools effectively; I monitor these closely.  If you are already sharing your progress in a public channel, and I ask for information that is redundant with that, please just kindly remind me where to look.

I have to switch contexts with great frequency.  Please assume that I am not in the same context as you when we begin a conversation, and help me get up to speed first.  I appreciate rather than am annoyed by a quick reminder to get grounded, and I will let you know in the moment if it is unnecessary.

**How to reach me?**
* for critical realtime communication, call me directly or walk over and talk.  Don't wait just because I look busy.
* for noncritical but near realtime communication, use Slack.
* for questions or responses that are more involved (e.g., >= 1 paragraph) or not time sensitive use email
* if in doubt, have a conversation.  Do **not** let technology be a barrier.

I am in a lot of meetings and sometimes have critical tasks.  However, you are almost always my top priority, so always reach out as soon as needed regardless of my state.  **DO NOT** let my current workload be a barrier.  I will do my best to respond as quickly as possible, and set expectations about when I can more fully respond.  Hold me accountable for this. 

Anytime you need a quick 1:1 or other discussion, please ask.  I will default to yes if at all possible, and will make it happen in short order if I am unavailable at the moment.  Ignore my calendar, it fills up.

If I say I am going to do something, I want you to hold me accountable for it.  I'm usually pretty good about following up in the expected timeframe, but sometimes things slip.  Friendly reminders are greatly appreciated rather than annoying!


### Initiative and creating value
Personal initiative is one of the most highly valued traits on the team.

I want you to place a high priority on gaining sufficient understanding of your projects and their potential impacts.  Focus on creating value within the project, rather than only doing the tasks that are assigned to you in isolation.  Focusing only on tasks leads you into the trap of assuming that someone else is responsible for everything else on the project, when in fact we may not have realized there were other things we should focus on.  Optimize for creating impacts for our clients, stakeholders, and users over optimizing your individual tasks.  

The project team is responsible for the success of the project; you are a critical part of that team.  You are not stepping on any toes if you ask for clarity around the context of the project and its impacts.  Continue to demand clarity until you solidly understand your role, responsibilities, and how those contribute to the success of the project.

Take initiative and bring ideas, but don't do so in isolation.  It is important to communicate your ideas early and often.  Validate and then run with those; I want to know you are working on the right things, so work toward validating alignment.  Sometimes we have to limit our options based on the project, but don't always assume that to be true!  


### Transparency
I will be as open as possible about what is going on at CBI and within our team.  Rarely there are things I am not able to share; I will tell you to the best of my ability that I am unable to share something if asked.

My calendar is public, and I share the status of what I am working on regularly and openly.  If you ever want to know about something I am working on, please ask.  I am happy to share!  (sometimes I assume others are not interested in the details of what I'm working on, and avoid sending out email blasts on these.  But please ask!)


### Inclusion & consensus (where possible & appropriate)
My management style involves creating a safe space where everyone feels heard and valued.  Each of us brings a valuable perspective (that's why you are here!), and I want to make sure you have the opportunity and desire to share that.  If any of my actions do not directly support a sense of safe space, you will be doing me a huge favor by letting me know.

I default to inclusion where the situation and the project allows for it.  Some situations simply do not allow everyone to be involved, and I will try to communicate those accordingly.  Most projects operate on very tight margins, so we are often juggling the need for a person's perspective versus our ability to afford it.  We also sometimes choose not to impact people's time unless we are sure they are essential for a discussion (we also recognize this is flawed logic and are working on it).  However, if you feel strongly that you would like to be included, *please* let me know and I will do what I can.

I default to consensus driven decisions where possible.  I am generally anti-authoritarian by nature; I want people to have a stake in the outcome rather than disengaged because they couldn't influence it.  This does not mean we make decisions by committee; I can and will make decisions as needed, and will refer other matters that I am not authorized to decide to other leaders for decisions.


### Empowerment of individuals
You are here because you are a talented contributor with a unique perspective.  I want you to feel empowered to bring your best work.  That means I often try to give you a lot of autonomy over your work.  I am working on better defining WHAT needs to be done at a high level for you to be successful, and I am trying hard to stop telling you HOW to do it.  

I am also working on helping reshape our dynamics within the team and CBI so that you have more individual empowerment and responsibility over your tasks.  I firmly believe you will be able to do better work if you are given the context within which that work needs to occur, rather than only assigning you very narrow scope tasks.

This means you own your time.  You are responsible for how and when you do your work.  I expect you to look ahead at what you will be working on in the future, and be preparing for that.  Do not wait until you are out of work to tell me you need guidance about what to work on, as this takes something that should be proactive and makes it reactive (and urgent!).

If there is anything I can do better to help you feel empowered, please tell me.


## What will disappoint me?
Insufficient communication and individual initiative are probably the two biggest offenders.  See above for what I expect.

I expect you to be constantly improving and being aware of where you need to improve.  Lack of introspection and self-awareness will lead to struggles between us.  Enlist me in your process!  The more I understand about what you are trying to improve, the more empathy and support I can provide.  Also tell me where my feedback or attempts to give you ideas are unwelcome.

We have very high standards for the quality and impact of our work.  I expect you to calibrate to those standards and exceed them regularly.  I expect you to work smart, not work hard.  Pushing yourself very hard but on the wrong thing does not win points; it costs us time and money we often don't have at our disposal.  If in doubt, let's discuss.

I expect you to understand what you are working on and WHY.  Doing something because you were "told to" but without sufficient understanding of it will lead to bad outcomes all around.  I want you to have personal ownership over the success of your projects.

I expect you to be well organized and manage the information you are responsible for.  You have control over how you go about it, but if you fail to keep track of the things you are responsible for, this will cause problems.  If I am providing you with verbal instructions, I expect you to capture those and if necessary, validate them back with me.  I may or may not also write these down as a convenience to us both, but if it is about your tasks, growth areas, etc, these are your primary responsibility, not mine.  If I am providing you feedback, I expect you to develop a system for keeping track of that.

If you are struggling with something - either at CBI or in your personal life - I will have empathy if you make me aware of it.  You do not need to share the details, but you do need to build awareness with me as to its impact on you.

I don't like surprises when we get close to project deadlines.  Keep me well-informed of both your progress and your availability.

I do not like sloppy work, but nor do I like unnecessary perfection at the beginning.  I fully understand that roughing out new code involves trying out lots of ideas, making and breaking things, etc.  But by the time that code, UI / UX design, documentation, etc matures, I expect it to be clean and high quality.  I expect you to guide that toward maturity rather than hand it off.  I expect you to take pride in your work; what you are building here needs to live beyond you, and be carried on by others.


## Personality quirks
I am highly detail oriented.  This means I will often get into the weeds quickly when doing a review of your code or especially your UI / UX.  However, you can calibrate my sensitivity to where you are at in your process: if you are seeking early input on a very rough idea, let me know you are not looking for detailed feedback; if you are looking for approval that a design is correct, expect me to default to high sensitivity to detail & correctness.

I am very passionate about some things, especially how software should work or how things are done.  I will often do a lot of arm waving and express strong opinions.  I subscribe to the model of "strong opinions, loosely held."  By sharing my opinion with you (however right I may sound), I am inviting you to offer an alternative perspective.  If I get too passionate, let me know!

My highest periods of stress are usually several days *before* the deadline.  I was never one to cram the night before a major test, and I am not one to push hard the night before a major deliverable.  I want to make sure that we have everything well in hand by the time we hit the deadline; this means preparing early.  Expect me to push you to complete things prior to deadlines.

I often "run hot" and can seem pretty stressed much of the time.  This is just my normal setting.  If it is having a negative impact on you, please let me know.


## I am working on:
* communicating context and expectations early, often, and clearly
* focusing on the big picture and impacts over the individual details
* holding people accountable for those expectations (including myself)
* finding better ways to communicate and teach things I am passionate about
* being less transparent about how I *feel* about a particular issue, and more transparent about the context for it

You have a valuable role in helping me improve.  You can help me identify the things I should be working on, or how I could approach things differently to be more effective.
